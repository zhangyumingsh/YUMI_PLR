# PLR Klipper

YUMI_PLR for Klipper is a simple print recovery system for Klipper, a 3D printer firmware. It allows you to resume prints after a power loss or other types of MCU disconnection interruption. Please note there is no guarantee that it will work in 100% of cases because the Z-axis must not have moved, so do not touch the machine in case of a power cut.

## Prerequisites
Being on a user named 'biqu' is mandatory. With the user biqu, having already installed Klipper, Moonraker, and Mainsail (you can use Kiauh).

To install YUMI_PLR Klipper, follow the steps below:
You must have created your Klipper installation with the user 'biqu'; the script does not yet fully handle other cases.
